The debate between static and dynamic websites is not new, but in recent years the advantages of static sites have become clearer than ever. Static sites, like those generated by Axcora AX SSG, pre-render every page at build time. This means that visitors receive perfectly optimized HTML files, resulting in lightning-fast load times.

Dynamic sites depend on server-side processing. Pages are generated on-the-fly, often querying databases and running backend logic for every visitor. While this is powerful and flexible, it comes at the cost of slower performance, increased security risks, and more complex hosting requirements.

Why are static sites regaining popularity in 2025? The answer is simple: user expectations are higher than ever. Search engines reward speed and reliability, and users abandon slow pages in seconds. With static sites, you get instant loading, maximum security, and easy deployment. No server-side code means dramatically less attack surface, and if you ever need to scale your site, static files can be served from any CDN with zero configuration.

Axcora AX SSG takes it a step further by making the build process simple and transparent. All your content and templates are stored in predictable folders, and there's no need for a complex build pipeline. You don’t have to worry about software rot, broken dependencies, or maintenance headaches.

While dynamic sites are still essential for e-commerce, social networks, and complex applications, static sites are perfect for blogs, portfolios, marketing pages, documentation, and any content-driven experience.

Static is beautiful—and in 2025, it’s more relevant than ever.
