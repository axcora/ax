The digital world is constantly evolving, and website developers are always searching for better ways to build and deploy fast, secure, and robust web experiences. Axcora AX SSG is an innovative static site generator designed around three goals: simplicity, speed, and developer happiness.

What makes AX truly unique is its minimalist approach. There’s **no node_modules** folder packed with thousands of dependencies. AX focuses on leveraging modern JavaScript, only using a handful of proven libraries for Markdown and templating. This means less risk of bugs, security vulnerabilities, and conflicting dependencies.

Setting up a project is refreshingly simple. The core project structure features a `content/` folder for your Markdown files, a `templates/` directory for Handlebars/HTML layouts, and a `data/` directory for your site’s reusable settings or custom data. When you run the build script, AX converts your content into static HTML files with clean URLs, SEO-ready metadata, and even generates a sitemap, RSS feed, and robots.txt—all automatically.

You can start with a simple command: `ax init mysite`. Add your content, run `ax build`, and your website is ready for deployment anywhere, from Netlify and Vercel to GitHub Pages and your own server.

For designers, AX is a blank canvas: use Handlebars templates to build any layout or user experience you can imagine. For developers, it’s a toolbox with just what you need—no more, no less.

Whether you're starting a blog, a portfolio site, or even a docs portal, Axcora AX SSG will help you deliver performant, maintainable, and ultra-fast websites.

Welcome to the new age of static site generation!
