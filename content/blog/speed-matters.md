Website speed isn't just a technical metric—it's a measure of user experience and business impact. Study after study shows that users are less likely to engage, convert, or return to slow websites. Google and other search engines now factor speed heavily into rankings, making fast-loading sites a top priority for SEO.

Axcora AX SSG was designed for maximum speed from the very first line of code. The minimalist build process eliminates unnecessary dependencies and complexity, ensuring that the resulting HTML files are optimized and lightweight. Assets are copied directly, and templates are rendered in-memory—no delays, no waiting.

But speed goes beyond the end-user experience. It affects your development workflow as well. With AX, building your site takes seconds, not minutes. There's no need to wait for a hundred npm packages to install, and no layers of processing that slow down your device. You focus your time on creating content and designing your templates, not troubleshooting build errors.

Fast websites convert visitors into customers. They enhance your brand’s credibility and drive better results. Static sites also scale easily: just upload the files to your hosting provider or CDN, and your site is instantly available worldwide.

Adopting AX SSG for your website means embracing a culture of performance. Minimalism and speed go hand in hand here, making it easier for everyone—designers, developers, and editors—to deliver an amazing user experience.

If you care about your audience, speed should be your first concern. Axcora AX SSG is the tool that makes it easy.
