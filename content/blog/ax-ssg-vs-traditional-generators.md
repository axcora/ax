When choosing a static site generator for your project, it’s important to weigh the strengths of different solutions. Many established SSGs—such as Jekyll, Hugo, or Gatsby—offer robust feature sets, strong community support, and plugins for nearly every need. However, these frameworks often introduce complexity, large node_modules directories, and longer setup times.

Axcora AX SSG takes a refreshing approach. It is streamlined, requiring only essential JavaScript libraries and no node_modules folder at all. This drastically reduces installation time and resource usage on your device. The learning curve is flatter, thanks to its transparent file and folder structure: content is organized in Markdown files, templates use Handlebars syntax, and data configuration is handled via simple JSON or YAML files.

Traditional SSGs benefit from maturity and powerful ecosystems, but this can mean managing dozens of third-party plugins, each with its own updates and documentation. AX SSG avoids this with integrated, low-dependency features: built-in pagination, collections, tag pages, and a full suite of site metadata (RSS, sitemap, robots.txt).

AX also stands out for its recursive templating system, letting you nest layouts and partials for maximum design flexibility without extra configuration. Performance is a priority—build times are measured in seconds, and it's easy to deploy anywhere, especially on lightweight static hosting platforms.

For developers who want simplicity without sacrificing capability, AX Cora AX SSG offers a refreshing, modern alternative. It’s ideal for blogs, documentation sites, portfolios, and landing pages where ease-of-use and speed are paramount. Try both approaches, and you’ll see how minimalism can be empowering.
