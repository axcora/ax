Templates are the heart of every website, defining how content is presented and how visitors experience your brand. Axcora AX SSG uses Handlebars as its template engine, offering a familiar and powerful way to create flexible page layouts.

With Handlebars, you can use simple variables, conditionals, looping over posts, and custom helpers to create dynamic structures. AX SSG exposes context variables to templates, including site data, posts, collections, tags, and custom metadata—giving you powerful control over every page’s design.

You can nest templates using layouts and partials, making it easy to keep your code DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself). For example, create a basic `layout.ax` file to define your header and footer, and then build individual page templates for your blog list, single post view, or tag archive. Use helpers like `slugify` to ensure clean URLs and safe output.

Creating a visually stunning blog or site is just a matter of writing the templates you want. There is no rigid system or predefined UI; AX gives you full creative freedom. You can implement card-based layouts, sidebar navigation, tag clouds, hero sections, or interactive lists—all within plain Handlebars syntax.

[Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) also makes it easy for teams to collaborate. Designers and content editors familiar with HTML can understand and edit templates, shortening review cycles and increasing productivity. Whether you’re building your site solo or with a team, Handlebars keeps your process smooth and adaptable.

AX’s minimalism doesn’t limit creativity—it unleashes it, by letting you focus on design and content, not framework complexity. Every website is unique, and with AX SSG and Handlebars, yours can be too!
