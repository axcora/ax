Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is essential for any public website, but configuring SEO tools and metadata can be a time-consuming task. With AX SSG by axcora team, you get advanced SEO automation out of the box, so you can focus more on your content and design.

Whenever you build your site with AX, it automatically generates a standards-compliant `sitemap.xml` based on your content and routes. This ensures search engines can efficiently crawl and index your entire site, including new blog posts, documentation pages, and tag archives. You don’t have to manually update routes or worry about missing links—AX handles everything dynamically from your folder structure.

For content discovery and syndication, AX also produces a valid `rss.xml` feed. This lets your audience subscribe to your blog or updates using news readers and helps content aggregators feature your work. Every time you publish, your RSS feed is also updated—no plugins required.

`robots.txt` is another vital SEO tool, guiding crawlers on how to interact with your site. AX auto-generates this file, including your sitemap URL and default policies that allow search engines to index your content. If you need advanced customizations, you can modify your `site.json` without touching the build logic.

All this automation means your site is instantly SEO-ready with every build. You never have to hassle with extra tools, scripts, or extensions. For projects where search engine presence is vital—blogs, portfolios, documentation, or landing pages—AX SSG provides powerful, maintenance-free SEO capabilities from day one.

SEO doesn’t have to be a dark art or maintenance headache. With Axcora AX SSG, it’s simple, transparent, and automatic.
