Content should be easy to create, edit, and maintain—without complex databases or clunky CMS systems. Axcora AX SSG uses Markdown files as its core content format, marrying powerful features with a user-friendly writing experience.

Markdown’s simplicity allows writers to focus on creating high-quality articles, documentation, and tutorials without wrestling with formatting tools. You can add headers, lists, images, links, and code blocks with just a few keystrokes. AX SSG reads Markdown files from your `content/` folders, parses their metadata via YAML or JSON frontmatter, and transforms everything into beautiful, SEO-ready HTML pages.

Organizing content is simple: use folders for blog posts, documentation, or sections, and subfolders for categories or tags. AX automatically generates collection pages, paginates blogs, and produces tag archives—there’s no need for additional plugins or scripts.

You can update your site with a text editor or even directly from your code repository. Writers, editors, and developers can collaborate efficiently: just add or modify Markdown files, commit your changes, and trigger a new build with a single command. There’s no need to train new team members on a complex CMS—the workflow is as easy as editing a README.

AX SSG’s integration with Markdown means that version control becomes effortless. You can track every change, roll back mistakes, and easily branch out for new features or content campaigns. Since Markdown is widely supported, importing or exporting your content for use elsewhere is straightforward.

For rich media, simply reference images or videos in your Markdown. Place related assets in the assets/ folder and AX will handle copying them during build. You can also embed code samples, tables, or links to other pages using standard Markdown or HTML syntax.

Axcora AX SSG’s philosophy is that content management should be empowering, not obstructive. Markdown gives you that power—freedom from complicated interfaces, full control over your site’s structure, and the ability to focus on what matters most: your message.

In a world where managing your content is often more work than creating it, AX SSG with Markdown brings joy back to publishing. Whether you’re building a personal blog, a documentation portal, or a full-fledged website, you’ll appreciate the speed and comfort of managing your content with AX.
