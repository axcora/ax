Axcora AX SSG is a [new nad unique static site generator (SSG)](/about.html) that prioritizes a minimalist approach—no node_modules directory required—focusing purely on core JavaScript and a handful of efficient libraries. Its streamlined architecture eliminates complex dependencies, allowing for superfast builds, easy maintenance, and an approachable learning curve for both beginners and experienced developers

**AX SSG by axcora** is a super-lightweight, [modern static site generator](/about.html) built for maximum speed, simplicity, and portability.
